This simple project is a showcase for:
- Simple ticketing system
- Single portal application

For the backend, I used the default Serenity demo, which is a straightforward TypeScript/.NET Core framework with useful demos.
You can customize the Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml to use the admin panel in dockerized environments as well.
